# Welcome to Elevated Access

This is the inaugural post for our technical blog focused on red team operations and offensive security.

## What to Expect

We'll be covering a wide range of topics including:

- **Tool Development**: Building custom tools for red team operations
- **Exploitation Techniques**: Analysis of vulnerabilities and exploitation methods
- **Operational Security**: Best practices for maintaining OPSEC during engagements
- **Infrastructure**: Setting up and managing red team infrastructure

## Contributing

This blog is designed to support multiple authors. Team members can contribute their own articles by creating markdown files in the `_posts` directory and adding their author profile to `_authors`.

## Getting Started

To add a new post:

1. Create a new file in `_posts` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add front matter with title, date, author, and categories
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Commit and push to the repository

Stay tuned for more technical content!

```bash
# Example code block
echo "Welcome to Elevated Access"
```

Happy hacking!
